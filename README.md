# HolaKit

Yet another design-driven UI component set.

## Usage

```html
<!-- Directly from unpkg (npm) -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/holakit/assets/holakit.min.css">
```

> WARNING: You should pin the version you use in your project, since we're still in 0.x stage and we can have some breaking changes at any time. We'll follow semver.

Or use CSS files in the npm package directly. You can exclude unnecessary parts of this project in `assets/holakit.css` and regenerate a build using `npm run build`. This project is using pure CSS with many edge-cutting CSS features, and doesn't do any transpilation except minifing. This means you will need to transpile using something like cssnext or auto-prefixer for better browser compatibility.

This project is mostly designed for Â¡Hola! usage, so the design may not be fit in your project. Pull requests are welcome though, for your or some others' case.
